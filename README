Swindon Events
==============

Collect and display all live music and other events going on in
Swindon in one coherent place.

The aim is collect data ourselves, rather than relying on / insisting
that others contribute data, as otherwise inevitably some data owners
won't see the need to contribute their data everywhere.

Members of the public and others will be invited to help contribute by
the simple mechanism of uploading photos of venue posters to social
networks or this website and tagging them appropriately. Website
members are then invited to create events based on the posters.

Initial data collection is done via public facebook event collection
and website scraping.
